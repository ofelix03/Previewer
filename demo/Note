Follow this instructions to setup DEMO

1. Make sure you have bower installed on your system. You can run  'bower -v' in your terminal to verify  
  whether it is installed or not. A version string should be spat on your terminal if bower is already installed, else checkout 'https://bower.io' on how to install it.

2. With bower installed, you can use it to install jQuery which is a dependency for this library and an 		optional FontAwesome which offers use font icons (arrow left, arrow right, and close) to improve the
	aethestics of the UI of this plugin. And as I said, FontAwesome is optional and is not a requirement. 

	Now let install jQuery and FontAwesome and get started playing with the DEMO. Run in your terminal:

	` bower install `

	Running the above code should setup everything right for playing with this library. Now just load the `index.html` file in your browser of choice and begin.

	NB: After running 'bower install' you should see two new folders inside the demo folder -- `jquery` and `font-awesome`
